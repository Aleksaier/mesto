# Project: Mesto

---

_Description_

- It is a part of the large project work.
- We implemented a responsive design.
- Media queries were used to achieve the goal.
- All links on the page smoothly become a little transparent when you hover the mouse.
- In some blocks we used CSS Grid Layout.

_Java Script_

- We used _functions_ to make the buttons work.
- The Document Object Model (DOM) was used to interact with the page.

- You can change the profile data and save it.
- Moreover, you can add a new card with the title.

- The posibility to delete a card is also added.
- You can mark the pictures you like.
- All popups open and close smoothly.
